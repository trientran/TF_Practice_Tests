# Question:

# Create a classifier for the MNIST dataset which includes black-and-white images of 10 digits (0-9). The input shape
# should be 28x28 monochrome and the model should classify 10 classes.

# Your task is to fill in the missing parts of the code block (where commented as "YOUR CODE HERE").

# Use Keras dataset

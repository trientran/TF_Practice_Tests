- import libs accordingly
- they dont mark how you code, they mark the output only with respect to the required input shape
- set epoch to 10-20 for image classification problems and early callback patient to 3-5 so we know if our model is not performing well and fine-tune it
- if you have to retrain the model, comment out the dataset downloading part to avoid redownloading
- check Python packages tab, open Doucmentatoio tab if possible
- in callback the mode is very important as it decide the logic to stop training
- input shape is important and must match the required one
- In general, the APIs of these two modules are very similar, and you can use either one to define a Sequential model in
your code. However, if you are using TensorFlow as your backend, it might be more convenient to use tensorflow.python.keras.models.Sequential.
Note that in the latest versions of TensorFlow, the tensorflow.python.keras module has been deprecated in favor of the
standalone keras module, so you should use keras.models.Sequential instead of tensorflow.python.keras.models.Sequential
for better compatibility with future versions of TensorFlow.

If you're using macOS go to Macintosh HD > Applications > Python3.6 folder (or whatever version of python you're using) > double click on "Install Certificates.command" file. :D
- do not install the latest version of Pycharm yet due to incompatibility
- install libs via Preferences not python packages tab
